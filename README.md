Unzip usb-serial-for-android-master to obtain the android project.

Either load emulator.hex into the pic, or bild and runcdc_serial_emulator.X project (i suggest the first option for simplicty)

I posted a video of the slider varying pwm. It's very slow however, I suspect due to the fact that the update rate of whatever functon I put y seekbar update into. By varying this I found I could get more a smoother transition of LED from bright to dark states.
